All contributions, ideas and bug reports are more than welcome! 
We encourage you to open an [issue](https://github.com/stavrostheocharis/auto-streamlit/issues) for any change you would like to make on this project.

## Workflow

If you wish to contribute, please follow this process:

## Dependencies

We use `venv` to manage the [dependencies](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
In order to run the needed scripts you need to have python installed and run the command below.

```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

To activate your `venv` run `source "env_name"/bin/activate`.

To install dependencies run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code style

Black is already into the dependencies (requirements.txt)
